# WES_analysis

This is a snakemake workflow for processing exome sequencing data, using primarily GATK software. There are two workflow implementations, which are:
- Single sample variant calling
- Joint variant calling

The input files are not included.

This workflow also includes validation with the NA12878 data.

## Dependencies

If you have conda and snakemake, then software installation is pretty much settled. Refer to yaml files in envs folderfor software details.
